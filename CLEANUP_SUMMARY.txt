CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. Moved all old dashboard versions to archive/old-components/
2. Moved superseded documentation to archive/old-docs/
3. Updated App.jsx to only import NOCDashboardV2
4. Removed references to old components (NOCTURNAL, CardVariants)
5. Cleaned up conditional logic for dashboard selection
6. Created archive/README.md to document archived files
7. Created PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for detailed file reference
8. Updated README.md with new features and structure

RESULT:
-------

Clean, maintainable codebase with:
- Single dashboard component (NOCDashboardV2.jsx)
- Clear documentation structure
- All old files preserved in archive/ for reference
- Updated project documentation

The archive/ folder can be safely deleted if historical reference is not needed.
All active code only references files outside the archive/ folder.
